This project was is an extension of @uuupah's Pain27 keyboard design. 
You can find the original repo here (https://github.com/uuupah/pain27/tree/master)

In this projecet we have updated the firmware of the Pain27 to work with Vial QMK. We are also planning to design a new case for the PCB

------------------------------
% Firmware: @cactushydroxide %
------------------------------

- The original firmware was compiled on https://kbfirmware.com. The project has stopped being updated by its developer. We have decided to update the firmware to work with QMK Vial (https://get.vial.today/) to help update the keyboard to fit with the modern keyboard firmware standards.

- The hex file of the project has been included in the main folder. You can flash it onto your own PCB via QMK Toolbox

- The buildfiles are also included if you are insterested in downloading them and building your own hex with different QMK and Vial functionality.
